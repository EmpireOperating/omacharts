//! The theme that follows the desktop.
//!
//! Omarchy writes a flat semantic palette to
//! `~/.local/state/omarchy/current/theme/colors.toml` and the theme's name to
//! `theme.name` beside it, rewriting both whenever the desktop theme changes.
//! We read those two files and map them onto a [`Theme`] — surfaces, text,
//! chart structure and the full indicator palette, since an Omarchy theme
//! already ships sixteen colours chosen to sit together.
//!
//! Polling beats inotify here: Omarchy swaps a symlinked directory, which is
//! exactly the case where watching a path either misses the change or needs
//! re-arming. Two `stat` calls on a timer cost nothing and never miss.
