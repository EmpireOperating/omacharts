//! The frame around the charts: the gutter between two panes, and the ring on
//! the one that has focus.
//!
//! Several charts tile the window the way a tiling window manager tiles the
//! screen, and the frame borrows that idiom because it is the one an Omarchy
//! user already reads without thinking: windows sit on a gap, and the focused
//! one wears a thin border in the theme's accent. Nothing else is drawn. A
//! border around every pane would be furniture competing with the candles,
//! and the chart is the main character.
//!
//! Both colours are derived from the theme rather than taken from it, for
//! the same reason the indicator palette is. A theme's own colours were
//! chosen for a terminal, and taken as they are they fail in ways the shipped
//! themes demonstrate: Solitude's accent pulled toward its background lands
//! on the exact grey of its axis line, Lumon's accent is the blue its candles
//! wear, and Lupine's panel colour is its chart colour to within a pixel
//! value. So the gutter is the window surface, lifted only when it cannot be
//! seen, and the ring keeps the accent's hue but has its lightness chosen to
//! be seen the same amount on every theme and to stay clear of everything
//! the chart draws.
