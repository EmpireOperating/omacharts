"""Build the generated half of the symbol inventory.

The curated half lives in crates/omacharts-engine/src/seed.tsv and is written
by hand: it carries the tier weights that make GC mean gold futures, the
session origins that make a 4H bar bucket correctly, and every futures root,
currency pair and crypto, none of which appear in any listings feed.

This writes the other half — every US-listed equity and ETF — from Nasdaq
Trader's daily files. They give a ticker and a name and nothing else, so
everything here lands at tier 2, below anything curated, and the merge at load
time lets a curated row win wherever both have a symbol.

Two more feeds say how well known each listing is, because a ticker and a name
cannot: eleven thousand rows that all look equally important make search spell
out microcaps ahead of household names. Equities are ranked by market cap and
ETFs by the money that actually changes hands in them, each onto the same 1-9
popularity band. Neither feed is load-bearing — when one is down the column
goes to `-` and search falls back to exactly the ordering it had before.
