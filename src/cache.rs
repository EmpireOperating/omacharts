//! Keeping the bar cache from growing for ever.
//!
//! Bars are kept so that a chart opened a second time is drawn from disk
//! instead of fetched, and until now nothing ever threw any of them away: a
//! year of opening charts was a database that only grew. This drops the
//! oldest of it back out when the whole thing passes a limit the user sets.
//!
//! Three things keep it from being felt. The size is read from SQLite's own
//! page counters rather than measured, which is a header read and nothing
//! else. The work happens on its own connection on its own thread, which is
//! what WAL is for. And it runs at most once every six hours, because a cache
//! sitting well under its limit is a question not worth asking twice in a day.
